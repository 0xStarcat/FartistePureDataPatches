Pure Data Patches used in Fartiste: Fart Sound Studio
by Wolphox

Fart_Patches naming key:

1) FartSynth.pd is the main file to open
2) fartPatch1_long.pd = rumbly fart voice
3) fartPatch2_long.pd = squeek voice
4) fartPatch3_puff.pd = tooting voice
5) _rev3_half.pd = same as PD's standard rev3 unit, just with half the reflections for better performance
6) The rest are just custom envelope controllers
